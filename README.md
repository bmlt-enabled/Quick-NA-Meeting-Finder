NA Meeting Finder iOS App
=========================

This app began life as a simple demo app of the BMLTiOSLib, but was deemed so full of WIN that it deserves its own existence.

It's a *VERY* simple app that has just one button. Pressing it locates you, and then finds nearby meetings that will be available either later today or tomorrow.

The whole idea of the app is to remove decision points for the user. Present a simple, straightforward path that gives them exactly the information they need to find an NA meeting.
